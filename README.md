# Multidimensional diffusion MRI data
This repository contains some simple data sets suitable for getting acquainted with the [MD-dMRI framework](https://github.com/daniel-topgaard/md-dmri/). The data was acquired on a Bruker microimaging system using liquid crystal phantoms as described in
* [Topgaard_NMRBiomed2019](https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4066)

## How to start
Download the [MD-dMRI framework](https://github.com/daniel-topgaard/md-dmri/) and add to the Matlab search path. Run step1_recon_data.m and step2_run_analysis.m in the data folders. View the raw or processed data with the graphical user interface started by typing `mgui` in the Matlab command window.
